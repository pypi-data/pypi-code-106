This is a usefull abstraction to \nwrite maintainable code and to dive into a project easilly.\n\nHandling API resources using an http client, such as `requests`_ does not handle\nthat abstraction, and does not handle bindings to object, and can be compared to\na raw connection because it is just a transport.\n\nThis is the problem blacksmith is solving, having a nice abstraction of a service.\n\n.. note::\n\n   | Blacksmith is not an HTTP Client or a model validator.\n   | Blacksmith use `httpx`_ to perform http query, and use `Pydantic`_ to validate models.\n\n.. _`requests`: https://docs.python-requests.org/\n.. _`httpx`: https://www.python-httpx.org/\n.. _`Pydantic`: https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/\n\n\nWhy not using a SDK to consume APIs ?\n-------------------------------------\n\nSDK are about importing an external library in a service. And a service is\nconsumed by many services for different purpose. As a result, SDK create\ncoupling between service, and this is something that should be avoid.\n\nAn SDK for a service will declare all the resources, routes, and attribute\nof resources when a service consumer may consume just a few.\n\nSDK may hide what is really used by every service.\n\nTo avoid this, every consumers of API, should declare its own consumers\ncontracts to get a better view of which service use what.\n\n.. note::\n\n   TLDR; SDK are fine in public API, by the way, but not in a microservices\n   architecture.\n\n\nBuilding SDK\n------------\n\nBy the way, public API provider comes with an SDK, which is a good case,\nand blacksmith can be used to build SDK for Python / asyncio. \n\n\nRead More\n---------\n\nYou can read the `full documentation of this library here`_.\n\n.. _`full documentation of this library here`: https://blacksmith.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/index.html\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n * Use isort and black to keep the code well formatted.\n * Write tests (Test driven development is encouraged).\n * Using just_ to run commands.\n\n.. _just: https://github.com/casey/just\n',
